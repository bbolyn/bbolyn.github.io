    <chapter number="1" title="Mr. Sherlock Holmes">
      <p>Mr. <person>Sherlock Holmes</person>, who was usually very late in the mornings,
      save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all
      night, was seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the
      hearth-rug and picked up the <object>stick</object> which our visitor had left
      behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood,
      bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a “Penang lawyer.”
      Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch
      across. “To James <person>Mortimer</person>, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the
      C.C.H.,” was engraved upon it, with the date “1884.” It was just
      such a <object>stick</object> as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to
      carry—dignified, solid, and reassuring.</p>

      <quote>“Well, <person>Watson</person>, what do you make of it?”</quote>

      <p><person>Holmes</person> was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no
      sign of my occupation.</p>

      <quote>“How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in
      the back of your head.”</quote>

      <quote>“I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in
      front of me,” said he. “But, tell me, <person>Watson</person>, what do you make of
      our visitor’s <object>stick</object>? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss
      him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance.
      Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.”</quote>

      <quote>“I think,” said I, following as far as I could the methods of my
      companion, “that Dr. <person>Mortimer</person> is a successful, elderly medical
      man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of
      their appreciation.”</quote>

      <quote>“Good!” said Holmes. “Excellent!”</quote>

      <quote>“I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a
      country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot.”</quote>

      <quote>“Why so?”</quote>

      <quote>“Because this <object>stick</object>, though originally a very handsome one has
      been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.
      The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a great amount
      of walking with it.”</quote>

      <quote>“Perfectly sound!” said Holmes.</quote>

      <quote>“And then again, there is the ‘friends of the C.C.H.’ I should
      guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose
      members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which
      has made him a small presentation in return.”</quote>

      <quote>“Really, <person>Watson</person>, you excel yourself,” said Holmes, pushing back
      his chair and lighting a cigarette. “I am bound to say that in
      all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own
      small achievements you have habitually underrated your own
      abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you
      are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius
      have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear
      fellow, that I am very much in your debt.”</quote>

      <p>He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words
      gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his
      indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had
      made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think
      that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way
      which earned his approval. He now took the <object>stick</object> from my hands
      and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with
      an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and
      carrying the <object>cane</object> to the window, he looked over it again with a
      convex lens.</p>

      <quote>“Interesting, though elementary,” said he as he returned to his
      favourite corner of the settee. “There are certainly one or two
      indications upon the <object>stick</object>. It gives us the basis for several
      deductions.”</quote>

      <quote>“Has anything escaped me?” I asked with some self-importance. “I
      trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have
      overlooked?”</quote>

      <quote>“I am afraid, my dear <person>Watson</person>, that most of your conclusions were
      erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be
      frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided
      towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this
      instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he
      walks a good deal.”</quote>

      <quote>“Then I was right.”</quote>

      <quote>“To that extent.”</quote>

      <quote>“But that was all.”</quote>

      <quote>“No, no, my dear <person>Watson</person>, not all—by no means all. I would
      suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more
      likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when
      the initials ‘C.C.’ are placed before that hospital the words
      ‘Charing Cross’ very naturally suggest themselves.”</quote>

      <quote>“You may be right.”</quote>

      <quote>“The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a
      working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our
      construction of this unknown visitor.”</quote>

      <quote>“Well, then, supposing that ‘C.C.H.’ does stand for ‘Charing
      Cross Hospital,’ what further inferences may we draw?”</quote>

      <quote>“Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!”</quote>

      <quote>“I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has
      practised in town before going to the country.”</quote>

      <quote>“I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look
      at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable
      that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends
      unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the
      moment when Dr. <person>Mortimer</person> withdrew from the service of the
      hospital in order to start a practice for himself. We know there
      has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from
      a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching
      our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the
      occasion of the change?”</quote>

      <quote>“It certainly seems probable.”</quote>

      <quote>“Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the _staff_
      of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London
      practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not
      drift into the country. What was he, then? If he was in the
      hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a
      house-surgeon or a house-physician—little more than a senior
      student. And he left five years ago—the date is on the <object>stick</object>. So
      your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin
      air, my dear <person>Watson</person>, and there emerges a young fellow under
      thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of
      a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger
      than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.”</quote>

      <p>I laughed incredulously as <person>Sherlock Holmes</person> leaned back in his
      settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.</p>
      <quote>“As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,” said I,
      “but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars
      about the man’s age and professional career.” From my small
      medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the
      name. There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our
      visitor. I read his record aloud.</quote>

      <quote>“<person>Mortimer</person>, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.
      House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.
      Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology, with
      essay entitled ‘Is Disease a Reversion?’  Corresponding member
      of the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of ‘Some Freaks of
      Atavism’ (Lancet 1882).  ‘Do We Progress?’ (Journal of
      Psychology, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the parishes of
      Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.”</quote>

      <quote>“No mention of that local hunt, <person>Watson</person>,” said Holmes with a
      mischievous smile, “but a country doctor, as you very astutely
      observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As
      to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable,
      unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is
      only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only
      an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country,
      and only an absent-minded one who leaves his <object>stick</object> and not his
      visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.”</quote>

      <quote>“And the dog?”</quote>

      <quote>“Has been in the habit of carrying this <object>stick</object> behind his master.
      Being a heavy <object>stick</object> the dog has held it tightly by the middle,
      and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog’s
      jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in
      my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It
      may have been—yes, by Jove, it _is_ a curly-haired spaniel.”</quote>

      <p>He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the
      recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his
      voice that I glanced up in surprise.</p>

      <quote>“My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?”</quote>

      <quote>“For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our
      very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don’t move, I
      beg you, <person>Watson</person>. He is a professional brother of yours, and your
      presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment
      of fate, <person>Watson</person>, when you hear a step upon the stair which is
      walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill.
      What does Dr. James <person>Mortimer</person>, the man of science, ask of Sherlock
      Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!”</quote>

      <quote>The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had
      expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin
      man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two
      keen, grey eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from
      behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a
      professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was
      dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was
      already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head
      and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes
      fell upon the <object>stick</object> in Holmes’s hand, and he ran towards it with
      an exclamation of joy. “I am so very glad,” said he. “I was not
      sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I
      would not lose that <object>stick</object> for the world.”</quote>

      <quote>“A presentation, I see,” said Holmes.</quote>

      <quote>“Yes, sir.”</quote>

      <quote>“From Charing Cross Hospital?”</quote>

      <quote>“From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.”</quote>

      <quote>“Dear, dear, that’s bad!” said Holmes, shaking his head.</quote>

      <quote>Dr. <person>Mortimer</person> blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.
      “Why was it bad?”</quote>

      <quote>“Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your
      marriage, you say?”</quote>

      <quote>“Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all
      hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home
      of my own.”</quote>

      <quote>“Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,” said Holmes.
      “And now, Dr. James <person>Mortimer</person>—”</quote>

      <quote>“Mister, sir, Mister—a humble M.R.C.S.”</quote>

      <quote>“And a man of precise mind, evidently.”</quote>

      <quote>“A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the
      shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr.
      <person>Sherlock Holmes</person> whom I am addressing and not—”</quote>

      <quote>“No, this is my friend Dr. <person>Watson</person>.”</quote>

      <quote>“Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in
      connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much,
      Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or
      such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any
      objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A
      cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would
      be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my
      intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.”</quote>

      <quote><person>Sherlock Holmes</person> waved our strange visitor into a chair. “You are
      an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am
      in mine,” said he. “I observe from your forefinger that you make
      your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.”</quote>

      <p>The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the
      other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers
      as agile and restless as the antennæ of an insect.</p>

      <quote>Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the
      interest which he took in our curious companion. “I presume,
      sir,” said he at last, “that it was not merely for the purpose of
      examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here
      last night and again today?”</quote>

      <quote>“No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of
      doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I
      recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am
      suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary
      problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest
      expert in Europe—”</quote>

      <quote>“Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?”
      asked Holmes with some asperity.</quote>

      <quote>“To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur
      Bertillon must always appeal strongly.”</quote>

      <quote>“Then had you not better consult him?”</quote>

      <quote>“I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a
      practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone.
      I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently—”</quote>

      <quote>“Just a little,” said Holmes. “I think, Dr. <person>Mortimer</person>, you would
      do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly
      what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my
      assistance.”</quote>
    </chapter>

    <chapter number="2" title="The Curse of the Baskervilles">
      <quote>“I have in my pocket a <object>manuscript</object>,” said Dr. James <person>Mortimer</person>.</quote>

      <quote>“I observed it as you entered the room,” said Holmes.</quote>

      <quote>“It is an old <object>manuscript</object>.”</quote>

      <quote>“Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.”</quote>

      <quote>“How can you say that, sir?”</quote>

      <quote>“You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all
      the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert
      who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so.
      You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject.
      I put that at 1730.”</quote>

      <quote>“The exact date is 1742.” Dr. <person>Mortimer</person> drew it from his
      breast-pocket. “This family paper was committed to my care by Sir
      Charles <person>Baskerville</person>, whose sudden and tragic death some three
      months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I may say
      that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant.
      He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as
      unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document very
      seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did
      eventually overtake him.”</quote>

      <quote>Holmes stretched out his hand for the <object>manuscript</object> and flattened it
      upon his knee. “You will observe, <person>Watson</person>, the alternative use of
      the long _s_ and the short. It is one of several indications
      which enabled me to fix the date.”</quote>

      <quote>I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded
      script. At the head was written: “<person>Baskerville</person> Hall,” and below in
      large, scrawling figures: “1742.”</quote>

      <quote>“It appears to be a statement of some sort.”</quote>

      <quote>“Yes, it is a statement of a certain <concept>legend</concept> which runs in the
      <person>Baskerville</person> family.”</quote>

      <quote>“But I understand that it is something more modern and practical
      upon which you wish to consult me?”</quote>

      <quote>“Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be
      decided within twenty-four hours. But the <object>manuscript</object> is short and
      is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I
      will read it to you.”</quote>

      <p>Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together,
      and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. <person>Mortimer</person>
      turned the <object>manuscript</object> to the light and read in a high, cracking
      voice the following curious, old-world narrative:</p>

      <quote>  “Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been
      many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo
      <person>Baskerville</person>, and as I had the story from my father, who also
      had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it
      occurred even as is here set forth. And I would have you
      believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may
      also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy
      but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed.  Learn
      then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but
      rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul
      passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not
      again be loosed to our undoing.</quote>

      <quote>“Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the
      history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most
      earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of
      <person>Baskerville</person> was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be
            gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless man.
            This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing
            that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there
            was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his
            name a by-word through the West.  It chanced that this Hugo
            came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known
            under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held
            lands near the <person>Baskerville</person> estate. But the young maiden,
            being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him,
            for she feared his evil name.  So it came to pass that one
            Michaelmas this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and
            wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off
            the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he
            well knew.  When they had brought her to the Hall the
            maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his
            friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly
            custom.  Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her
            wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths
            which came up to her from below, for they say that the
            words used by Hugo <person>Baskerville</person>, when he was in wine, were
            such as might blast the man who said them.  At last in the
            stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted
            the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the
            growth of ivy which covered (and still covers) the south
            wall she came down from under the eaves, and so homeward
            across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall
            and her father’s farm.</quote>

      <quote>“It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his
            guests to carry food and drink—with other worse things,
            perchance—to his captive, and so found the cage empty and
            the bird escaped.  Then, as it would seem, he became as one
            that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the
            dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table, flagons and
            trenchers flying before him, and he cried aloud before all
            the company that he would that very night render his body
            and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the
            wench.  And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of
            the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than
            the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon
            her.  Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms
            that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and
            giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid’s, he swung them
            to the line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the
            moor.</quote>

      <quote>“Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to
            understand all that had been done in such haste.  But anon
            their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which
            was like to be done upon the moorlands.  Everything was now
            in an uproar, some calling for their pistols, some for
            their horses, and some for another flask of wine.  But at
            length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and the
            whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started
            in pursuit.  The moon shone clear above them, and they rode
            swiftly abreast, taking that course which the maid must
            needs have taken if she were to reach her own home.</quote>

      <quote>“They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the
            night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him
            to know if he had seen the hunt.  And the man, as the story
            goes, was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak,
            but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy
            maiden, with the hounds upon her track.  ‘But I have seen
            more than that,’ said he, ‘for Hugo <person>Baskerville</person> passed me
            upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a
            hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels.’
            So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward.
             But soon their skins turned cold, for there came a
            galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with
            white froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty
            saddle.  Then the revellers rode close together, for a
            great fear was on them, but they still followed over the
            moor, though each, had he been alone, would have been right
            glad to have turned his horse’s head.  Riding slowly in
            this fashion they came at last upon the hounds.  These,
            though known for their valour and their breed, were
            whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal,
            as we call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some,
            with starting hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the
            narrow valley before them.</quote>

      <quote>“The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may
            guess, than when they started.  The most of them would by
            no means advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may
            be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal. Now, it
            opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great
            stones, still to be seen there, which were set by certain
            forgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon was shining
            bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the
            unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of fear and of
            fatigue.  But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was
            it that of the body of Hugo <person>Baskerville</person> lying near her,
            which raised the hair upon the heads of these three
            dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo,
            and plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a
            great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than
            any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon.  And even
            as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo
            <person>Baskerville</person>, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and
            dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and
            rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor.  One,
            it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and
            the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their
            days.</quote>

      <quote>“Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound
            which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever
            since.  If I have set it down it is because that which is
            clearly known hath less terror than that which is but
            hinted at and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that many of
            the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have
            been sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we shelter
            ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence, which
            would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or
            fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ.  To
            that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I
            counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the
            moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are
            exalted.</quote>

      <quote>“[This from Hugo <person>Baskerville</person> to his sons Rodger and John,
            with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their
            sister Elizabeth.]”</quote>

      <p>When Dr. <person>Mortimer</person> had finished reading this singular narrative he
      pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr.
      <person>Sherlock Holmes</person>. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his
      cigarette into the fire.</p>

      <quote>“Well?” said he.</quote>

      <quote>“Do you not find it interesting?”</quote>

      <quote>“To a collector of fairy tales.”</quote>

      <p>Dr. <person>Mortimer</person> drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.</p>

      <quote>“Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more
      recent. This is the _Devon County Chronicle_ of May 14th of this
      year. It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of
      Sir Charles <person>Baskerville</person> which occurred a few days before that
      date.”</quote>

      <p>My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became
      intent. Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:</p>

      <quote>“The recent sudden death of Sir Charles <person>Baskerville</person>, whose name
        has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for
        Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the
        county.  Though Sir Charles had resided at <person>Baskerville</person> Hall for
        a comparatively short period his amiability of character and
        extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who
        had been brought into contact with him.  In these days of
        _nouveaux riches_ it is refreshing to find a case where the
        scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days
        is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him
        to restore the fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is
        well known, made large sums of money in South African
        speculation. More wise than those who go on until the wheel
        turns against them, he realised his gains and returned to
        England with them.  It is only two years since he took up his
        residence at <person>Baskerville</person> Hall, and it is common talk how large
        were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have
        been interrupted by his death.  Being himself childless, it was
        his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should,
        within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many
        will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.  His
        generous donations to local and county charities have been
        frequently chronicled in these columns.</quote>

      <quote>“The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles
            cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the
            inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of
            those rumours to which local superstition has given rise.
            There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to
            imagine that death could be from any but natural causes.
            Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to
            have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In
            spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his
            personal tastes, and his indoor servants at <person>Baskerville</person>
            Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the
            husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper. Their
            evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to
            show that Sir Charles’s health has for some time been
            impaired, and points especially to some affection of the
            heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour,
            breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.
            Dr. James <person>Mortimer</person>, the friend and medical attendant of the
            deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.</quote>

      <quote>“The facts of the case are simple.  Sir Charles <person>Baskerville</person>
            was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking
            down the famous yew alley of <person>Baskerville</person> Hall.  The
            evidence of the Barrymores shows that this had been his
            custom. On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his
            intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered
            Barrymore to prepare his luggage.  That night he went out
            as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he
            was in the habit of smoking a cigar.  He never returned.
            At twelve o’clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still
            open, became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in
            search of his master.  The day had been wet, and Sir
            Charles’s footmarks were easily traced down the alley.
            Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on
            to the moor. There were indications that Sir Charles had
            stood for some little time here.  He then proceeded down
            the alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body
            was discovered. One fact which has not been explained is
            the statement of Barrymore that his master’s footprints
            altered their character from the time that he passed the
            moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have
            been walking upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy
            horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the
            time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the
            worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is
            unable to state from what direction they came.  No signs of
            violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles’s person,
            and though the doctor’s evidence pointed to an almost
            incredible facial distortion—so great that Dr. <person>Mortimer</person>
            refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend
            and patient who lay before him—it was explained that that
            is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnœa and
            death from cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne
            out by the post-mortem examination, which showed
            long-standing organic disease, and the coroner’s jury
            returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.
             It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the
            utmost importance that Sir Charles’s heir should settle at
            the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly
            interrupted.  Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not
            finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been
            whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been
            difficult to find a tenant for <person>Baskerville</person> Hall.  It is
            understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry <person>Baskerville</person>,
            if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles <person>Baskerville</person>’s
            younger brother.  The young man when last heard of was in
            America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to
            informing him of his good fortune.”</quote>

      <quote>Dr. <person>Mortimer</person> refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket.
      “Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the
      death of Sir Charles <person>Baskerville</person>.”</quote>

      <quote>“I must thank you,” said <person>Sherlock Holmes</person>, “for calling my
      attention to a case which certainly presents some features of
      interest. I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but
      I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the
      Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch
      with several interesting English cases. This article, you say,
      contains all the public facts?”</quote>

      <quote>“It does.”</quote>

      <quote>“Then let me have the private ones.” He leaned back, put his
      finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial
      expression.</quote>

      <quote>“In doing so,” said Dr. <person>Mortimer</person>, who had begun to show signs of
      some strong emotion, “I am telling that which I have not confided
      to anyone. My motive for withholding it from the coroner’s
      inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in
      the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition.
      I had the further motive that <person>Baskerville</person> Hall, as the paper
      says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to
      increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these
      reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less
      than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but
      with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.</quote>

      <quote>“The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near
      each other are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a
      good deal of Sir Charles <person>Baskerville</person>. With the exception of Mr.
      Frankland, of Lafter Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist,
      there are no other men of education within many miles. Sir
      Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his illness brought
      us together, and a community of interests in science kept us so.
      He had brought back much scientific information from South
      Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together
      discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the
      Hottentot.</quote>

      <quote>“Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me
      that Sir Charles’s nervous system was strained to the breaking
      point. He had taken this <concept>legend</concept> which I have read you exceedingly
      to heart—so much so that, although he would walk in his own
      grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at
      night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was
      honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and
      certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors
      were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence
      constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has
      asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen
      any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter
      question he put to me several times, and always with a voice
      which vibrated with excitement.</quote>

      <quote>“I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some
      three weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall
      door. I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of
      him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and
      stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror. I
      whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something
      which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the
      drive. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go
      down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for
      it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the
      worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the
      evening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion
      which he had shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative
      which I read to you when first I came. I mention this small
      episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy
      which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter
      was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no
      justification.</quote>

      <quote>“It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London.
      His heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in
      which he lived, however chimerical the cause of it might be, was
      evidently having a serious effect upon his health. I thought that
      a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a
      new man. Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned at
      his state of health, was of the same opinion. At the last instant
      came this terrible catastrophe.</quote>

      <quote>“On the night of Sir Charles’s death Barrymore the butler, who
      made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me,
      and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach <person>Baskerville</person> Hall
      within an hour of the event. I checked and corroborated all the
      facts which were mentioned at the inquest. I followed the
      footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate
      where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the
      shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no
      other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and
      finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched
      until my arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his
      fingers dug into the ground, and his features convulsed with some
      strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn
      to his identity. There was certainly no physical injury of any
      kind. But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the
      inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the ground round
      the body. He did not observe any. But I did—some little distance
      off, but fresh and clear.”</quote>

      <quote>“Footprints?”</quote>

      <quote>“Footprints.”</quote>

      <quote>“A man’s or a woman’s?”</quote>

      <p>Dr. <person>Mortimer</person> looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice
      sank almost to a whisper as he answered.</p>

      <quote>“Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!”</quote>
