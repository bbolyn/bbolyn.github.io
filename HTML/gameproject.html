      <h2>Artist's Statement</h2>
      <p>
  For my final Twine project, I created <strong>Toxic Gym</strong>, a game about chaotic gym culture and social media pressure. I wanted to make something that felt fun, but also pointed out how toxic and ridiculous some fitness spaces and influencer environments can be. The game blends humor with serious consequences, using stats like credibility, health, gains, followers, and injury risk. Depending on how players navigate situations like spotting bros, filming viral challenges, or forgetting their gym bag, they land in different outcomes ranging from burnout to internet fame.
  I used ChatGPT throughout the process to help brainstorm ideas, come up with some descriptions, and especially to generate cartoon-style images that matched each scene. For example, I’d describe what kind of scene I wanted, like someone spilling a protein shake or getting caught taking a bathroom selfie, and it would help generate art I could use in the game. This made the whole thing feel more polished. However, I did NOT use AI to write any of the game’s code or logic. I took full control of how the game functions by learning Twine’s Harlowe macro system and designing all the branching logic manually. All of the conditionals, variables, and stat calculations were things I wrote and tested myself.
  One of the most rewarding parts was when it all started working, when the stats would update properly, different endings would trigger based on what happened, and the images made each scene feel unique. I also enjoyed the creative writing side of it. Getting to mix gym stereotypes with over-the-top internet culture made it easy to come up with ridiculous but believable scenarios. I think the game feels funny without being too unrealistic.
  One of the hardest parts was the layout. Twine doesn't always behave well when it comes to visuals, especially when embedding custom images in nearly every passage. I had to learn how to structure my HTML and CSS just to make everything line up right and not look broken when switching between scenes. It also took time to get the game looking clean when embedded into my portfolio website. At first, the stats bar wasn’t updating consistently and some of the image scaling looked off, but I eventually figured out a good system for styling and loading everything.
  If I were to continue working on this game, I’d want to make the stats feel more alive. Right now, they change behind the scenes and are visible at the bottom, but they could use animations or more noticeable popups that highlight your decisions, like a “+5000 followers!” burst when you go viral. I’d also explore adding simple sound effects or background music, especially for the endings. Another fun addition might be a personality test at the end that sums up what kind of gym-goer you became. Overall, I’m proud of how this turned out and how much I learned about both storytelling and interactive design.
