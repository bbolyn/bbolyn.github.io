      <h2>Artist's Statement</h2>
      <p>For my final Twine project, I created <strong>Toxic Gym</strong>, a game about chaotic gym culture and social media pressure. It mixes humor and serious choices with different outcomes depending on your stats.</p>
      <p>I used ChatGPT to help generate ideas and make custom images for every passage. This helped bring the game to life visually. I DID NOT use AI to write the code, I did all of that on my own by learning Twine macros and variable systems.</p>
      <p>The most rewarding part was getting everything to work together. Writing, logic, and images. It felt like a real project coming to life.</p>
      <p>One frustrating part was trying to make the layout and images behave on every page. But I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and how Twine works.</p>
      <p>If I could improve anything in the future, Iâ€™d make the stats react more dramatically in real-time and maybe add music or sound.</p>
